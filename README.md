# Design Patterns in TypeScript

This project is a personal study of classic design patterns implemented in TypeScript. It aims to deepen understanding of software architecture principles and improve practical coding skills using modern JavaScript/TypeScript features.

The repository includes implementations and examples of the following patterns:

- Creational Patterns
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
- Structural Patterns
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
- Behavioral Patterns
  - Chain of Responsibility

Each pattern is isolated in its own directory with code examples and documentation.
